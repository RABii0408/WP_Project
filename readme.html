{Need projects source for this}
An Ajax endpoint that will output the last three published "Projects" that belong in the "Project Type" called "Architecture" If the user is not logged in. If the user is logged In it should return the last six published "Projects" in the project type call. "Architecture". Results should be returned in the following JSON format {success: true, data: [{object}, {object}, {object}, {object}, {object}]}. The object should contain three properties (id, title, link).
